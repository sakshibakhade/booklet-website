# booklet-website

I developed a Booklet Website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery to provide an interactive online bookstore experience. The website features a responsive navigation bar with links to sections such as Features, Sign Up, How-it-works, Wishlist and Contact Us for smooth browsing.

In the Books section, different categories like Fiction Books, Self-help Books, and more are showcased. When users click on a Explore Button, they are able to  dedicated book stock page, where they can explore the collection of books  in detail. Each stock page also includes a Back button that allows users to return quickly to the main website.

A key functionality of the website is the Wishlist feature. Users can click on the wishlist button to save their favorite books while exploring collections. The selected books are stored in the Wishlist section, where users can conveniently view and manage their saved items.

To enhance user experience, jQuery animations are used for smooth transitions, interactive effects, and improved navigation flow.
